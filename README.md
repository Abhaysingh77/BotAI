# BotAI
## How to run the services and use the application
1. cd BotAI
2. npm run dev

## Reasoning behind technical choices
I have used react.js and MUI because:-
            1. Easy to use
            2. Familiarity with concepts of JS
            3. Strong community support

## Design choices
I thought of it as a complete drawer so that I have used Mui drawer component

### Trade offs or left out
1. Not built the separate component for conversation history instead made it in the drawer section to access each chats detail separately
2. Although implemented every aspect but facing issue with the rendering of feedbacks.
